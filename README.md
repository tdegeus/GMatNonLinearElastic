# Implementation

## C++ and Python

The code is a C++ header-only library (see [installation notes](#c-headers)), 
but a Python module is also provided (see [installation notes](#python-module)).
The interfaces are identical except:

+   All *xtensor* objects (`xt::xtensor<...>`) are *NumPy* arrays in Python. 
    Overloading based on rank is also available in Python.
+   The Python module cannot change output objects in-place: 
    only functions whose name starts with a capital letter are included, see below.
+   All `::` in C++ are `.` in Python.

## Cartesian3d

[Cartesian3d.h](include/GMatNonLinearElastic/Cartesian3d.h)

### Overview

At the material point level to model is implemented in the class:

+   `NonLinearElastic`: non-linear elastic material model.

There is an `Array` class that allows you to
have a single API for an array of material points. 

>   Note that all strain tensors are presumed symmetric. 
>   No checks are made to ensure this.

### Example

Only a partial examples are presented here, meant to understand the code's structure.

#### Individual material point

```cpp
#include <GMatNonLinearElastic/Cartesian3d.h>

namespace GMat = GMatNonLinearElastic::Cartesian3d;

int main()
{
    // a single material point
    GMat::NonLinearElastic model(kappa, sig0, eps0, m);
    ...
    
    // set strain (follows e.g. from FEM discretisation)
    xt::xtensor<double, 2> Eps;
    ...
    model.setStrain(Eps);
    ...
    
    // compute stress (including allocation of the result)
    auto Sig = elastic.Stress();
    // OR compute stress without (re)allocating the results
    // in this case "Sig" has to be of the correct type and shape
    model.stress(Sig); 
    ...

    return 0;
}
```

#### Array of material points

```cpp
#include <GMatNonLinearElastic/Cartesian3d.h>

namespace GMat = GMatNonLinearElastic::Cartesian3d;

int main()
{
    size_t ndim = 3;
    
    // array, of shape [nelem, nip], of material points
    GMat::Array<2> array({nelem, nip});

    // set materials:
    // points where I(x,y) == 1 are assigned, points where I(x,y) == 0 are skipped
    // all points can only be assigned once
    array.setNonLinearElastic(kappa, sig0, eps0, m);
    ...

    // set strain tensor (follows e.g. from FEM discretisation)
    xt::xtensor<double,4> eps = xt::empty<double>({nelem, nip, ndim, ndim});
    ... 
    array.setStrain(eps);

    // compute stress (allocate result)
    xt::xtensor<double,4> sig = array.Stress();
    // OR compute stress without (re)allocating the results
    // in this case "sig" has to be of the correct type and shape
    array.stress(sig); 
    ...

    return 0;
}
```

### Function names

+   Functions whose name starts with a capital letter (e.g. `Stress`) 
    return their result (allocating it internally).
+   Functions whose name starts with a small letter (e.g. `stress`) 
    write to the, fully allocated, last input argument(s) 
    (avoiding re-allocation, but making the user responsible to do it properly).

### Storage

+   Scalar
    ```cpp
    double
    ```
    or
    ```cpp
    xt::xtensor<double, 0>
    ```

+   Tensors
    ```cpp
    xt:xtensor<double, 2> // 2nd-order tensor
    xt:xtensor<double, 4> // 4th-order tensor
    ```

+   List *(i)* of second order tensors *(x,y)* : *A(i,x,y)*
    ```cpp
    xt::xtensor<double,3>
    ```
    Note that the shape is `[I, 3, 3]`.

+   Matrix *(i,j)* of second order tensors *(x,y)* : *A(i,j,x,y)*
    ```cpp
    xt::xtensor<double,4>
    ```
    Note that the shape is `[I, J, 3, 3]`.

## Debugging

To enable assertions define `GMATNONLINEARELASTIC_ENABLE_ASSERT` 
**before** including *GMatNonLinearElastic* for the first time. 

Using *CMake* this can be done using the `GMatNonLinearElastic::assert` target 
(see [below](#using-cmake)).

>   To also enable assertions of *xtensor* also define `XTENSOR_ENABLE_ASSERT` 
>   **before** including *xtensor* (and *GMatNonLinearElastic*) for the first time. 
>   
>   Using *CMake* all assertions are enabled using the `GMatNonLinearElastic::debug` target 
>   (see [below](#using-cmake)).

>   The library's assertions are enabled in the Python interface, 
>   but debugging with *xtensor* is disabled.

# Installation

## C++ headers

### Using conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge gmatnonlinearelastic
```

### From source

```bash
# Download GMatNonLinearElastic
git checkout https://github.com/tdegeus/GMatNonLinearElastic.git
cd GMatNonLinearElastic

# Install headers, CMake and pkg-config support
cmake .
make install
```

## Python module

### Using conda

```bash
conda install -c conda-forge python-gmatnonlinearelastic
```

Note that *xsimd* and hardware optimisations are **not enabled**. 
To enable them you have to compile on your system, as is discussed next.

### From source

>   You need *xtensor*, *pyxtensor* and optionally *xsimd* as prerequisites. 
>   Additionally, Python needs to know how to find them. 
>   The easiest is to use *conda* to get the prerequisites:
> 
>   ```bash
>   conda install -c conda-forge pyxtensor
>   conda install -c conda-forge xsimd
>   ```
>   
>   If you then compile and install with the same environment 
>   you should be good to go. 
>   Otherwise, a bit of manual labour might be needed to
>   treat the dependencies.

```bash
# Download GMatNonLinearElastic
git checkout https://github.com/tdegeus/GMatNonLinearElastic.git
cd GMatNonLinearElastic

# Compile and install the Python module
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
# OR you can use one command (but with less readable output)
python -m pip install .
```

# Compiling

## Using CMake

### Example

Using *GMatNonLinearElastic* your `CMakeLists.txt` can be as follows

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
project(example)
find_package(GMatNonLinearElastic REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE GMatNonLinearElastic)
```

### Targets

The following targets are available:

*   `GMatNonLinearElastic`
    Includes *GMatNonLinearElastic* and the *xtensor* dependency.

*   `GMatNonLinearElastic::assert`
    Enables assertions by defining `GMATNONLINEARELASTIC_ENABLE_ASSERT`.

*   `GMatNonLinearElastic::debug`
    Enables all assertions by defining 
    `GMATNONLINEARELASTIC_ENABLE_ASSERT` and `XTENSOR_ENABLE_ASSERT`.

*   `GMatNonLinearElastic::compiler_warings`
    Enables compiler warnings (generic).

### Optimisation

It is advised to think about compiler optimization and enabling *xsimd*. 
Using *CMake* this can be done using the `xtensor::optimize` and `xtensor::use_xsimd` targets. 
The above example then becomes:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.1)
project(example)
find_package(GMatNonLinearElastic REQUIRED)
add_executable(example example.cpp)
target_link_libraries(example PRIVATE 
    GMatNonLinearElastic 
    xtensor::optimize 
    xtensor::use_xsimd)
```

See the [documentation of xtensor](https://xtensor.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) concerning optimization.

## By hand

Presuming that the compiler is `c++`, compile using:

```
c++ -I/path/to/GMatNonLinearElastic/include ...
```

Note that you have to take care of the *xtensor* dependency, the C++ version, optimization, 
enabling *xsimd*, ...

## Using pkg-config

Presuming that the compiler is `c++`, compile using:

```
c++ `pkg-config --cflags GMatNonLinearElastic` ...
```

Note that you have to take care of the *xtensor* dependency, the C++ version, optimization, 
enabling *xsimd*, ...

# Testing

## Basic testing

>   Run by the continuous integration

```
cd build
cmake .. -DBUILD_TESTS=1
make
./test/unit-tests
```

## Extensive testing

>   Run by the continuous integration.
>   See [ci.yaml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for details.

To make sure that the current version in up-to-date with old versions,
one starts by generating a set or random states using the current version:

```
cd test/compare_versions
python Cartesian3d_generate.py
```

And then checks that the generated states are also found with previous
versions:

```
git checkout tags/v0.1.3
python setup.py build
python setup.py install
python Cartesian2d_check_v0.1.3.py
```

etc.

See [ci.yaml](.github/workflows/ci.yml) for details.

# Upgrading instructions

## Upgrading to >v0.2.*

`xtensor_fixed` was completely deprecated in v0.2.0, as were the type aliases 
`Tensor2` and `Tensor4`. 
Please update your code as follows:

*   `Tensor2` -> `xt::xtensor<double, 2>`.
*   `Tensor4` -> `xt::xtensor<double, 4>`.

**Tip:** Used `auto` as return type as much as possible.
This simplifies implementation, and renders is less subjective to library 
return type changes.

Compared to v0.1.0, v0.2.0 has some generalisations and efficiency updates. 
This requires the following changes:

*   `Matrix` has been generalised to `Array<rank>`. Practically this requires changing:
    -   `Matrix` to `Array<2>` in C++.
    -   `Matrix` to `Array2d` in Python. 
        Note that `Array1d`, `Array3d`, are also available.

*   `Array<rank>.check` -> 
    ```cpp
    if (xt::any(xt::equal(array.type(), Type::Unset))) {
        throw std::runtime_error("Please set all points");
    }
    ```
    Note however that it is no longer required to set all points, 
    unset points are filled-up with zeros.

*   Strain is now stored as a member. 
    Functions like `stress` now return the state based on the last specified strain, 
    specified using `setStrain(Esp)`. This leads to the following changes:
    - `stress`: no argument.
    - `tangent`: no argument, single return value (no longer returns stress).

# Change-log

## v0.2.0

Compared to v0.1.0, v0.2.0 has some generalisations and efficiency updates. 
This requires the following changes:

*   `Matrix` has been generalised to `Array<rank>`. Practically this requires changing:
    -   `Matrix` to `Array<2>` in C++.
    -   `Matrix` to `Array2d` in Python. 
        Note that `Array1d`, `Array3d`, are also available.

*   `Array` now sets zeros for all `Type::Unset` points. 
    The function `check` is deprecated accordingly.

*   Strain is now stored as a member. 
    Functions like `stress` now return the state based on the last specified strain, 
    specified using `setStrain(Esp)`. This leads to the following changes:
    - `stress`: no argument.
    - `tangent`: no argument, single return value (no longer returns stress).

*   Tensor operations are now provided centrally in the GMat eco-system, 
    by GMatTensor
